# BitMind Platform Demo

This is a demo of the BitMind platform. It is a simple web application that allows users to create new projects and provision compute resources for them.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown in the terminal to view the site.

**Note:** The local Python interpreter doesn't work when running the development server. You will need to build the app first and preview the production build to see the Python interpreter in action.

Building the app.

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build.

```bash
npm run preview
```
